I am a third-year undergraduate student at Andrews University, majoring in mathematics and minoring in religion. I am the current Vice President of the Andrews University Chapter of Engineers Without Borders and the President of the Michigan Gamma Chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon. I am also a J. N. Andrews Honors Scholar and a Barry M. Goldwater Scholar. My research interests span pure and applied mathematics, but so far I have mostly focused on mathematical ecology. In my free time (when I happen to find some!) I enjoy reading, the outdoors, programming, and photography.

Such superficial statements, however, fail to do justice to the complex person that I am. I like to summarize myself by saying that I am just another unique individual, striving to explore and contribute to the rich tapestry of our universe.
