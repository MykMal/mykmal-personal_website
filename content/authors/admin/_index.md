I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Andrews University, majoring in mathematics and minoring in computing. My research interests span the intersection of mathematics, ecology, and data science. In particular, I synthesize analytical and computational approaches to study complex systems such as emerging infectious diseases, climate change, and chemical reaction networks. People often like to know that I am a Goldwater Scholar and a J. N. Andrews Honors Scholar. I am also passionate about volunteering and lead out in my university's Pi Mu Epsilon chapter, Engineers Without Borders chapter, and math/physics club. In my free time (when I happen to find some!) I enjoy reading classic literature, hiking the great outdoors, playing video games, and gardening.

I plan to earn a PhD with the goal of pursuing a career in academia. Overall, my dream is to employ theoretical approaches to understand the natural world while engaging underrepresented groups in scientific research.

For additional details see my [short résumé](files/Mykhaylo-Malakhov-resume.pdf) or [comprehensive curriculum vitae](files/Mykhaylo-Malakhov-cv.pdf).
