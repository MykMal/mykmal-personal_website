I am a statistician, epidemiologist, and machine learning engineer. Currently I find myself in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, where I am a first-year doctoral student. My passion lies in developing data science methods to solve complex problems in biomedical research and public health. Previously I studied mathematics at Andrews University, augmenting my experience with endeavors such as building a solar energy system in Madagascar and doing "maths" in Budapest. When away from my office I enjoy hiking the great outdoors, playing video games, and spending time with my wonderful partner.

I plan to pursue a research career within the medical or healthcare industries. Right now I am open to internship offers!
