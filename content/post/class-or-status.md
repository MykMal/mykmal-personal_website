To celebrate the last week of my sophomore year of college, I am starting a new blog series where I will post essays that I have written for my various classes. I will post each essay exactly as I submitted it for the class assignment, without any revisions.

​To start off, here is the very first essay that I wrote in college. I wrote it for Honors Western Heritage--a required year-long class for freshmen in the J. N. Andrews Honors Program. Like other Honors classes at Andrews University, Western Heritage takes an interdisciplinary, great books approach to liberal arts education. Over the course of that year we traced the development of world history, culture and arts, and religion from ancient Mesopotamian civilizations to the global aftermath of World War II.

I will be glad to hear your thoughts in the comments. Enjoy!

## ​Class or Status: A Comparison of Agency in _The Ramayana_ and the Bible

There is something beautifully striking about comparing and contrasting cultures that at first glance appear to, in many ways, be the epitomes of diametric opposition. Yet even in such cases, commonalities abound as each civilization attempts to find answers to the same questions, answers which depend on its unique history, cultural context, and myriad other factors. One of the fundamental questions that every civilization is bound to address is that of the construction of the human subject. In this broad topic, an area of particular interest and difference is the amount of agency ascribed to individuals, and the factors shaping that understanding. When comparing and contrasting agency as articulated in _The Ramayana_ and the Bible, we find that the basic notion of agency is identical. However, contrasts are also present due to the different social structures in the two societies being described. In the caste-dominated social structure of _The Ramayana_, a positive correlation exists between one's caste and the amount of agency he or she possesses. In the Bible, on the other hand, there are only two levels of agency: a high level always belonging to God's people, and most of the time to everyone else, and a low level belonging to those who are not part of God's people when God chooses to intervene. These varying levels of agency directly influence the way an individual views the world and constitute an inextricable component of one's sense of self.

The concept of agency in _The Ramayana_ is most clearly visible in the incident where Rama and Lakshmana meet Kabandha during their search for Ravana. Kabandha is described as "the strangest monster they had ever seen." Kabandha has the appearance of a huge tree trunk with a single eye, and possesses two monstrous arms with which he grabs Rama and Lakshmana, intending to eat them. Fortunately, the quick wits of our two protagonists combined with the monster's clumsiness save them, but what is significant for this analysis is Kabandha's life story. As he later describes, previously he was not an ugly monster (Menon 218). Kabandha was originally Dhanu, the archer of the sky, the god represented by the constellation Sagittarius (219, 689). Despite his strength and brilliance, one fateful day Dhanu happened to offend Indra, the god-king of all other celestial beings, and Indra struck off his legs. At first glance Indra's action might appear to be the result of his superior strength, but the next sentence reveals that there was much more than mere strength or ability involved. Kabandha explains that Brahma, the creator god and one of the members of the Hindu Trinity, said, "'Live hunting with your arms, Dhanu'" (219, 688). Brahma cursed Dhanu, and the text makes it clear that Dhanu, now known as Kabandha, was in bondage and lost the memory of his former life (219). In other words, he did not have the power to act as he desired, to use his maya and take on any appearance he wished. Kabandha's ability to act as a free agent was restricted by a certain set of limits imposed on him by another being; his agency was limited by an outside factor beyond his control. This completely changed his purpose in life, his view of himself, and his perception of the world. Before he was the archer of the sky, traversing its farthest reaches, and now he is a stationary monster. Before he saw himself as one of the most beautiful beings, but now he calls himself ugly. This simple restriction of agency likewise caused him to forget his once brilliant past, and to be content with living for mere survival.

It is also crucial to note the relationships between Dhanu, Indra, and Brahma. Among the tribal Aryan peoples, Indra was the primary God, the one who summoned the tribes to war (Duiker and Spielvogel 45). By the time _The Ramayana_ was written ca. 100 B.C.E., Indra had somewhat declined in importance and Brahma had replaced him as the highest god (46, 52). In either case, both deities were on a higher level than Dhanu, i.e., they were of a higher caste. From this we can infer that higher beings can sway the lives of those lower than them by restricting their agency--their ability to act on their own.

Ravana also gets to face the prospect of his life being transformed by a higher being restricting his agency. While flying he once saw an apsara who "was enchanting," and he "desired her." He remembers how he "accosted her, but she would not have [him]." So he forced himself on her, and after she complained Brahma came to Ravana in a dream and told him that if he ever did such a thing again his "head would burst in a thousand pieces" (Menon 364). In this case we see a higher being threatening to encroach on a lower being's ability to act as he wishes, and the reference to Ravana's head implies that this is a mental control. Finally, the concept of a higher being limiting the agency of a lower one is also visible in the overall plot of _The Ramayana_. In the sixth kanda, where we find the climax of the story, Ravana expends the entire resources of Lanka and even himself to fight Rama, yet he still loses. The reason for his loss is quite subtle. During his second council Ravana exclaims, "I have honors across the three worlds; I own their treasures and their fealty. I have trampled on the heads of my enemies." He and his fellow rakshasas enumerate the gods they have conquered; none were able to stand in their path (267). Yet, as just illustrated, there was one god who was able to impose limits on Ravana: Brahma. Brahma is a member of the Hindu Trinity, together with Vishnu and Shiva. Since no other beings are higher than the members of the Hindu Trinity, Ravana was of a lower class than Rama, the avatar of Vishnu (696). Furthermore, Rama's sole purpose in life was to kill Ravana (487). Therefore, Ravana did not have a choice. His war was already lost before the first shot was fired, since his fate was predetermined by a higher being. Once again, we see a lower being's agency limited by a higher being.

A very similar, yet at the same time vastly different, situation exists in the Bible. We can easily find stories of people using their agency to make their own decisions. For instance, we read that when Eve "saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate" (Gen. 3.6). She used her reason to make an informed decision to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In fact, not once in the Bible do we find an occurrence of God intervening to restrict the agency of any of his followers. In most cases, individuals are always free to act as they please. They often reap the consequences of their actions, such as when Adam and Eve were driven out of the garden of Eden for eating the forbidden fruit or when Noah and his family were saved when they obeyed God's command to build an ark. However, nothing restricts people from making their own decisions and using their faculties to the fullest extent. This is precisely what enabled God's people to enter into covenant relationships with God himself. Since covenants or agreements are made between equals, in a way this high level of agency prompted God's people to consider themselves equal to God. This is also evident in the way people talked to God. For example, Abraham often had conversations with God in which he talked to him as to another person, a friend even (Gen. 15.1-8). Thus, the high level of agency ascribed to individuals in the Bible gave them a high estimate of their status and played a key role in the development of the Jewish nation and the formation of Old Testament theology.

Only one exception exists to this general trend. In certain isolated cases, in order to accomplish his purposes, God will restrict the agency of an individual who refuses to follow him. A striking example is the story of the exodus of the children of Israel. After the tenth plague, when the Hebrew tribes were finally allowed to leave Egypt, they asked for "articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing" from the Egyptians, and "the LORD [gave] the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they granted them what they requested" (Ex. 12.35-36). The Egyptians did not give these expensive items to the children of Israel of their own accord; the text clearly tells us that it was God who engendered their generous feelings. In other words, God restricted the Egyptians' agency. After the Israelite tribes left, the same situation occurred. When the tribes came up to the Red Sea, God told Moses that he "'will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them'" (Ex. 14.17). God was trying to bring about a certain set of events, and in order to accomplish this he saw fit to restrict the agency of his people's enemies, forcing them to act according to his intentions. In these rare cases, the Bible is very similar to _The Ramayana_. When he sees fit, a higher being restricts the agency of a lower one, thereby altering history.

As we have seen, the basic concept of agency in _The Ramayana_ and the Bible is the same. In both books, beings are free to make choices and act independently, up to a certain point. In _The Ramayana_, they enjoy full agency until a higher-caste being decides to intervene. The lower a being's caste, the more beings there are above him or her, and the greater the probability that that being's agency will be restricted in some way. Naturally, no one is able to restrict the agency of Brahma, since there is no one above him. In the Bible, on the other hand, we find what is essentially a two caste system. There are only two levels: people and God. Therefore God is the only one able to restrict the agency of people, and, just as in _The Ramayana_, none can restrict God's agency. Moreover, God chooses not to restrict the agency of those who follow him or whom he has chosen, and only sometimes limits those who are against his people. These contrasting amounts of agency in _The Ramayana_ and the Bible are in many ways responsible for the different perceptions of self in these two books, and are a fundamental part of the foundation for the development of differing worldviews in the two societies.
