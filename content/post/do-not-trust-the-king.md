Halloween carries two different meanings. For one, it is the day on which we carve pumpkins and adorn our dwellings with fake cobwebs as we relish the haunted aspects of life. On the other hand, October 31 marks the anniversary of the Protestant Reformation, the day when Martin Luther nailed his famous *Ninety-five Theses* to the doors of a Wittenberg church. While distinct, these two commemorations sometimes overlap. To celebrate both meanings of Halloween I am posting an essay where I examine how Shakespeare's spookiest play borrows from and pushes back against central ideas in Protestant Christianity.

This post is a continuation of my current blog series, where I share my college essays exactly as I submitted them for the class assignments. In particular, I wrote this essay for the second semester of Honors Western Heritage in my sophomore year at Andrews University. What do you think of my reading of *Hamlet*? Let me know in the comments!

## Do Not Trust the King: Authority and Agency in *Hamlet*

England in the sixteenth century, along with most other European countries, was characterized by tumult and a general fragmentation of purpose. Society was experiencing an identity crisis unlike any seen previously, which created an atmosphere ready for the Protestant notion of predestination and its offer of assurance and certainty. Yet not all thinkers readily embraced this new form of theology and its call for unquestioning faith. Shakespeare reflected the skepticism, and through a meticulous development of the interpersonal relationships in *Hamlet* he offers a subtle critique of Calvinist theology. The precarious juxtaposition of King Claudius's desired control over Hamlet with Hamlet's assertion of individual agency in lieu of a trusting relationship with the King allegorically depict the author's uneasy attitude toward contradictions in Protestantism.

Characterized by religious wars, revolutions, and a lapsing economy, the 1500's are rightly known as Europe's age of crisis. In England political and religious confusion were especially intertwined, beginning from Henry VIII's desire to divorce his first wife in favor of a new one. Exasperated by the pope's denial, he took a major step in sloughing off Catholic hegemony and in 1534 prompted Parliament to officially declare that the king is the only supreme head of the Church of England (Duiker and Spielvogel 386-87). Consequently, England's religious sympathies oscillated with each coming monarch. Henry was succeeded by Edward VI, who was much more conducive to actual church reform than his father and allowed Thomas Cranmer "to move the Church of England ... in a more Protestant direction" (Duiker and Spielvogel 387). However, Edward's successor Mary I undid the progress and attempted to make England more Catholic than it had ever been, plunging the country into mayhem.

While England was attempting to ascertain its religious inclinations, the relatively serene hills of Basel witnessed the writing of a seminal book that ended up shaping the course of the Protestant Reformation. The *Institutes of the Christian Religion*, written by the French reformer John Calvin, is most notable for its emphasis on God's sovereignty and the resulting doctrine of unconditional election of the saints (Placher 189). Such a doctrine inevitably raises the question of why God chooses to act in the arbitrary way he does. Calvin himself admits this, and responds by saying that whoever "attempts to search out things that the Lord has willed to be hid in himself" will "enter into a labyrinth from which he can find no exit" (21.1). Calvin's theology is rooted in a deep fideism, an acceptance of things for no other reason than because God has so willed it. In an even more general sense, Calvin decries inquiring into knowledge as being a "foolish and dangerous, nay, even deadly" activity (21.2). In stark contrast to the political and religious instability enveloping England at this time, Calvin presents a God offering blissful ignorance and requiring blind faith.

In *Hamlet*, Shakespeare offers a number of details to intimate that he intends to comment on mainstream Calvinist Christianity. Indeed, Shakespeare perspicuously frames the plot of *Hamlet* around a well-known statement of Calvin's: "Madmen, why do you demand that God's power make flesh to be and not to be flesh at the same time!" (qtd. in Placher 191). Although Calvin wrote this in relation to the debate within Protestantism concerning transubstantiation in the Eucharist (Placher 191), literate viewers would have connected plot themes in *Hamlet* with Calvin's remark. Upon first seeing the Ghost, Hamlet refers to it as a spirit and exclaims, "Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned ... Thou com'st in such a questionable shape" (1.4.40, 1.4.44). But several lines later he reveals his uncertainty as to whether the Ghost is spirit or flesh by calling out, "thou, dead corpse, again in complete steel" (1.4.62). The connection to madness appears in the next scene, where Hamlet tells Horatio and Marcellus, "How strange or odd some'er I bear myself / (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet / To put an antic disposition on) --" (1.5.68-70). Hamlet's feigned madness is a central theme in the play, and continues to pervade it throughout. Moreover, Shakespeare borrows Calvin's "to be or not to be" phrasing for Hamlet's climactic soliloquy. Here, all three concepts from Calvin's statement converge as Hamlet, being tested for madness by Polonius (3.1.29-36), echoes his doubt of the Ghost's identity by pondering what happens after death: "what dreams may come / When we have shuffled off this mortal coil" (3.1.65-66), the "dread of something after death / (The undiscovered country from whose bourn / No traveler returns)" (3.1.77-79).

Theater was highly censored at this time by the state-appointed Master of Revels (Corredera), so Shakespeare could not overtly critique religion. Having drawn the connection to Calvinism, he relied on allegorical motifs to divulge his views. The primary such motif is King Claudius as representing God. In England the monarch did not only have a God-given right to the throne, but also the supreme headship of the Church. This position "gave him control of doctrine, clerical appointments, and discipline" (Duiker and Spielvogel 387). The king was the vicar of Christ on earth, and as such represented God himself more so than any other individual. Viewers at the time would have readily recognized that King Claudius symbolizes God, and thus any interaction between Claudius and other individuals can be seen as an interaction between God and people.

King Claudius does not hesitate to make his intentions for his subjects known, revealing them in the very first scene in which he appears. When Claudius and Hamlet speak in the courtroom the former reprimands Hamlet's "obstinate condolement" as "unmanly grief" that "shows a will most incorrect to heaven," nay, a will that is even "a fault to heaven" (1.2.93-95, 1.2.101). Furthermore, Claudius desires full and unquestioning obedience when he commands Hamlet "to remain / Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye" instead of fulfilling his own resolve to complete his education in Wittenberg (1.2.115-16). Claudius supposes that his obdurate, unloving stepson will probably refuse to submit to his dictatorial demands, and uses negative words to describe Hamlet: "impious," "unmanly," "incorrect," "unfortified," "impatient," and "unschooled" (1.2.94-97). But Hamlet surprises the King by responding with meek obedience, and King Claudius's attitude instantly reverses. Claudius shows his approval of full, blind obedience by now praising Hamlet with positive words such as "loving," "fair," "gentle," "smiling," and "grace" (1.21.121-24). Later on, when the people of Denmark almost succeed in crowning Laertes king, Claudius explicitly states his God-like authority: "There's such divinity doth hedge a king / That treason can but peep to what it would, / Acts little of his will" (4.5.123-25). King Claudius, just like Calvin's God, is unperturbed by people's actions and asserts himself as the all-sovereign ruler dictating the lives of his agency-lacking subjects.

Although Hamlet initially pays lip service to Claudius's demand for unconditional submission, throughout the play he distrusts everyone's intentions, especially those of King Claudius. For Hamlet it is insufficient that a statement comes from the highest authority, it must foremost be true. For this reason, Hamlet does not seek to determine the Ghost's true identity, but instead tests the truth of its statement. He decides to "have these players / Play something like the murder of my father / Before mine uncle" (2.2.529-31). Neither the Ghost's authoritative status nor King Claudius's matter to him; Hamlet distrusts both and seeks to evaluate the truth of their claims, after which he will "know [his] course" (2.2.33) and make his own decision. The truth value of statements is of utmost importance to Hamlet, and he bemoans that "to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand" (2.2.175-76). Yet to discern truth from falsehood reason must be used. In his soliloquy immediately before setting sail towards England with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet concludes that someone who simply succumbs to Fortune by thinking "but to sleep and feed" is "A beast -- no more" (4.4.34). We were not given "That capability and godlike reason," Hamlet continues, for it "To fust in us unused" (4.437-38). Hence, he proceeds to use his reason and agency to take control of the situation by intercepting and rewriting the King's letters (5.2.12-47). Hamlet reveals his high view of reason and unwillingness to accept fate even more clearly when he confides to Horatio, "my dear soul was mistress of her choice / And could of men distinguish her election" (3.2.59-60). Hamlet asserts his agency, refusing to give it up to a higher power.

Even though Hamlet refuses to surrender his agency to an all-sovereign king and the Protestant God he symbolizes, Hamlet's ability to ascribe such high importance to himself as an individual is a direct result of the Reformation. In Martin Luther's writings "there appears a figure who is absent from moral theories in" earlier periods, "the figure of 'the individual'" (MacIntyre 121). By doing away with priests and the church as intermediaries of salvation, the Reformation establishes the individual in a position of great agency, a position where "he no longer finds his evaluative commitments [of identity, and hence purpose] made for him" (MacIntyre 126). By simply acknowledging his power to make decisions about his future---to answer that proverbial question of "To be, or not to be" (3.1.55)---Hamlet establishes himself as the Protestant "moral agent [who is] sovereign in his choices" (MacIntyre 126). Ultimately, in his final words, Hamlet exclaims, "But I do prophesy th'election lights / On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice" (5.2.339-40). Even as he dies, Hamlet grasps hold of his agency as a Protestant individual, a sovereign moral agent who chooses his legacy and successor.

As a result, Shakespeare's Hamlet is at once indebted to the Reformation but in opposition to it. Through the main character of his longest play Shakespeare reflects on the Protestant response to Europe's political and religious instability. By replacing the unstable dictatorial control of a Church with the arbitrary control of a dictatorial God, Calvinist Protestantism created an inherently contradictory religion in which the individual is at once sovereign in his choices but subject to a God who predestines his future. Shakespeare portrays this unstable synthesis through an allegory where a demanding king asserts his divine control while his adopted son refuses the offer of a trusting relationship, preferring to remain a sovereign agent. The play uncomfortably clashes these ideals, pointing out the impossibility of their harmonious coexistence. Shakespeare implores his viewers to apprehend that both the play and the Protestant Christianity it represents end in confusion, dissatisfaction, and unanswered questions. *Hamlet* still warns us today that no promises of earthly or heavenly certainty can ever make bondage to a despot, even if divine, worth the sacrifice.
