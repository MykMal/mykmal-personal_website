I cannot recall how long ago I first decided to start a blog. It was certainly before I became a teenager, probably long before then. My dad is a software engineer, so I grew up in a fairly tech-fluent home and concepts like blogging were not at all foreign to my young self. However, the concept of having enough time to do everything you want to certainly was. It would be impossible for me to count the number of times I told myself that I should start a blog soon. Yet whenever I made such resolutions, time was always scarce. When I did have enough time, I chose to do other things instead.

Years passed by. High school came and went. Now, here I am, technically an adult, a first-year college student who is supposed to be more busy than ever before in his life. Yet somehow, precisely at this time in my life my blog left the expansive and crowded fantasy world of my future plans and dreams, and migrated to the world of reality. This blog post is dedicated to the celebration of that unprecedented and monumental transition. On this year's lonely and dreary Thanksgiving Day, I am profoundly happy and thankful for the opportunity to take part in commemorating such a historic event. May the adventure begin!
